This web app can be tested via GitHub Pages at https://thegreenbeaver.github.io/users_app/
<h3>Some comments on what I've done</h3>
<ul>
<li>At first I've had an idea of fitting Redux in this App, but it soon turned out to be even more of an overkill than 
I had imagined, so I got rid of it completely</li>
<li>I do know that storing private data like tokens in the LocalStorage is totally unacceptable, but the appropriate 
  way to do this requires quite a bit of server action, so I left this little crutch be</li>
<li>GitHub Pages seem to have some weird troubles with loading images, and thus reloading the page while at the Exact 
User tab kinda breaks it. When launched from a localhost, it all works completely fine - there are no code problems here</li>
</ul>
